# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
This project involved the use of ETL methods in combination with PySpark in Python 3, Hadoop, PostgreSQL and the pgAdmin programming environment, for the purpose of analyzing a copora of 50 separate datasets, each containing a collection of Amazon Vine Program reviews for a single product.  Amazon Vine is an intivation-only program intended to promote selected accounts as "Vine Voices" who are provided with free products in exchange for high-quality reviews.     

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze the corpora of review datasets for latent biases.  Since the reviewers in question are being compensated by Amazon for their reviews, there is a strong basis for suspecting that they might exhibit some form of favoritism in exchange.
